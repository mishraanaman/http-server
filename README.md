# HTTP Server
This project demonstrates a simple HTTP server built using different programming languages. The server provides two main functionalities: managing a list of "friends" and displaying a basic HTML message. It serves as an example of how to handle HTTP requests, parse URLs, and work with data streams in Node.js.

## Features
